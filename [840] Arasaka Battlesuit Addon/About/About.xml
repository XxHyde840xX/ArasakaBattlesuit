<description>Arasaka Battlesuit. The armor is an add-on to the Arasaka Corporation mod and requires it. Commissioned for RP purposes, so the stats were not relevant to me. Went for simplicity and balance. It does not require a tech print only the Arasaka Research. The cost is the same as cataphract armor to make in materials and worktime - but it only has the defensive stats of marine armor. This is because this armor only has a -0.12 movement penalty as well as some minor toxic resistance. Cataphract armor is stronger defensively. This one is better for mobility. You basically "overpay" for marine armor to reduce the mobility penalty from -0.4 to -0.12. -0.28 difference, as well as toxic resistance.

Commissioned by Ouroboros.
Made by Ogam.
Thanks to ILuvSilicon for fixing XML.
